# Music Merge

This is a simple application to merge music entries from multiple Skyrim mods.

It is currently only being tested on Skyrim Special Edition, but it should be easy enough to add
support for the rest of the Elder Scrolls games, as well as the Fallout series.

I am hoping to extract the core of the application into a general purpose Rust library for working
with Elder Scrolls and Fallout plugins.


## Build

This project is built on the Rust programming language. It currently requires a relatively recent
nightly build of the reference implementation. I highly suggest using `rustup` to install and
maintain your installation of the language.

While not required, I recommend using Visual Studio Code with the `Rust` extension by `kalitaalexey`
on the VSCode extension market for the best IDE experience I have found for the language so far.

## Contributing

While I have enjoyed learning Rust, this is my first real project built upon the language, so
please forgive my horrible code. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
